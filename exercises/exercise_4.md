# Exercise 4: Spring Annotations

## Part 1 - Configuration and Class Annotations

Create a simple structure of some POJO classes, services and repositories. Preferebly use interfaces where possible/needed. Once you have these classes, wire them up in a DI fashion using ``@Beans``.

* Move all your beans into a configuration file. Apply the appropriate 'discovery' annotations where needed.
* Replace your configuration file with Spring class annotations and Autowired.

Having set up you application using both methods, which method do you prefer and why would you choose one above the other?

## Part 2 - Qualifiers

Create a second implementation of a service/repository you just created and configure/annotate it accordingly. 

* What would happen now if you run your application? 
* How can you fix it?

## Part 3 - Properties

Use one of your existing classes, or create a new class and have its fields populated by using properties, provided by a properties file.
